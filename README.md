# Structures

## Description

This project is designed to process variables and evaluate mathematical expressions through the use of different data structures including arrays, sets, linked lists and trees. The program follows this systematic approach:

* Variable extraction form txt files
* Hash-based set implementation
* Infix-to-postfix conversion
* Expression tree construction
* Binary search tree sorting
